# MACHINE-LEARNING-1
# Data-Cleaning.
You will practice your data cleaning skills on the main data (not the summarized version) by perfoming the following tasks:

Explore the missingness in the dataset for categorical and numerical data
Develop a strategy to deal with the missing values, i.e deletion, imputation by mean or mode etc, whilst providing rationale for your approach.
Drop non-consequntial fields
Transform temporal data to their corrrect format (date time)
Perfom a full EDA and demonstrate the validity of the following assumptions

# CHIP-DATASET:
The data comes from CHIP Dataset.

Moore's Law.)
Wikipedia - Moore's Law
Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend. Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production.
