## THE-BLUEBERRY-YIELD-PREDICTION(REGRESSION-PROJECT)

"The dataset used for predictive modeling was generated by the Wild Blueberry Pollination Simulation Model, which is an open-source, spatially-explicit computer simulation program that enables exploration of how various factors, including plant spatial arrangement, outcrossing and self-pollination, bee species compositions and weather conditions, in isolation and combination, affect pollination efficiency and yield of the wild blueberry agroecosystem. The simulation model has been validated by the field observation and experimental data collected in Maine USA and Canadian Maritimes during the last 30 years and now is a useful tool for hypothesis testing and theory development for wild blueberry pollination researches."

# Files
train.csv - the training dataset; yield is the target
test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the yield given the other features
save and submit in a submission.csv file.
